    If no bqm is specified, the vartype of the SampleSet will be "BINARY" and the energies will be NaN.

    Note:
        The convention commonly used in quantum computing is that 0 in a bitstring represents eigenvalue 1 of an Ising Hamiltonian,
        and 1 represents eigenvalue -1.
        However, there is another convention, used in dimod, where the mapping is 0 -> -1 and 1 -> 1 instead.
        Therefore if we try to use the bitstrings coming from solving the problem framed in one convention
        to evaluate energy for problem state in the second one, the results will be incorrect.
        This might happen in the following scenario:
        1. Create a qubo
        2. Solve qubo using dimod solver
        3. Transform qubo to Ising problem
        4. Solve Ising problem using QAOA
        The bitstring coming from steps 2 and 4 will be flipped – 0s and 1s will be exchanged.
        First convention is the one used in `Measurements` in `zquantum.core` and the second one
        is used in `SampleSet` in `dimod`. In order to flip the bits in bitstrings, one should use `change_bitstring_convention` flag.
