    The main reason for its existence is to make it easier to keep backward

    won't require changing the base class of the already implemented samplers.

        intuitive to use, as some people find the term "sampling" confusing in
        the context of combinatorial optimization problems.

            This method should not be overwritten by inheriting classes as it's
            intended only as a utility or "thin wrapper". Any logic should be included
